feat: Resolve build errors and update admin page

- Created a new API route `/api/contact-submissions` to handle server-side fetching of contact submissions, resolving the 'fs' module error during build.
- Updated `src/app/admin/page.tsx` to fetch data from the new API route.
- Ensured React and React-DOM versions are set to 18.2.0 to resolve peer dependency conflicts.
